### notes
- A secure cookie can only be transmitted over an encrypted connection (i.e., HTTPS). They cannot be transmitted over unencrypted connections (i.e., HTTP). This makes the cookie less likely to be exposed to cookie theft via eavesdropping. A cookie is made secure by adding the secure flag to the cookie.

### Fuzz testing
- Web application fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a black box testing method. It is a quality checking and assurance technique used to identify coding errors and security loopholes in web applications. Huge amounts of random data called “Fuzz” is generated by the fuzz testing tools (Fuzzers) and used against the target web application to discover vulnerabilities that can be exploited by various attacks.
- types
  -  mutation-based type of fuzz testing,
      -   the current data samples create new test data and the new test data again mutates to generate further random data. This type of testing starts with a valid sample and keeps mutating until the target is reached.
  -  protocol-based type of testing
      -   the protocol fuzzer sends forged packets to the target application that is to be tested. This type of testing requires detailed knowledge of the protocol format being tested. This type of testing involves writing a list of specifications into the fuzzer tool, then performing a model-based test generation technique to go through all the listed specifications and adding irregularities in the data contents, sequence, and so on.
  - Source code reviews
    -  are used to detect bugs and irregularities in the developed web applications. It can be performed manually or by automated tools to identify the specific areas in the application code to handle functions regarding authentication, session management, and data validation. It can identify the unvalidated data vulnerabilities and poor coding techniques of the developers that allow attackers to exploit the web applications.

# threats
- Sensitive data exposure
  -  takes place due to flaws such as insecure cryptographic storage and information leakage. When an application uses poorly written encryption code to securely encrypt and store sensitive data in the database, the attacker can exploit this flaw and steal or modify weakly protected sensitive data such as credit cards numbers, SSNs, and other authentication credentials.
- Using misconfiguration vulnerabilities such as unvalidated inputs, parameter/form tampering, improper error handling, insufficient transport layer protection, and so on, attackers gain unauthorized accesses to default accounts, read unused pages, read/write unprotected files and directories, and so on. Security misconfiguration can occur at any level of an application stack, including the platform, webserver, application server, framework, and custom code.

# attacks
- Connection String Parameter Pollution (CSPP) 
  - specifically exploits the semicolon delimited database connection strings that are constructed dynamically based on the user inputs from web applications. So, injecting parameters into a connection string using semicolons as a separator is performed for a CSPP attack.
- cross-site scripting,
  -  attackers bypass client-ID security mechanisms and gain access privileges, and then inject malicious scripts into specific webpages. These malicious scripts can even rewrite HTML website content. 
  -     IMG SRC=vbscript:msgbox("Vulnerable");> originalAttribute="SRC" originalPath="vbscript:msgbox("Vulnerable");>" 
- cross-site request forgery method 
  - a kind of attack in which an authenticated user is made to perform certain tasks on the web application that an attacker chooses. 
- command injection, 
  - attackers identify an input validation flaw in an application and exploit the vulnerability by injecting a malicious command in the application to execute supplied arbitrary commands on the host operating system. 
-  SQL injection technique
   -  an attacker injects malicious SQL queries into the user input form either to gain unauthorized access to a database or to retrieve information directly from the database. 
- username enumeration
  - if the login error states that part of the user name and password is not correct, the attacker guesses the users of the application using the trial-and-error method. Here, an attacker tries to enumerate the username and password of “rini Mathew” on wordpress.com. On the first attempt, the attacker tried to login as “rini.mathews,” which resulted in the login failure message “invalid email or username.” On the second attempt, the attacker tried to login as “rinimathews,” which resulted in a message stating that the password entered for the username was incorrect, thus confirming that the username “rinimathews” exists. Some applications automatically generate account user names based on a sequence (e.g., “user101” and “user102”). Therefore, attackers can perform username enumeration by determining the appropriate sequence.
