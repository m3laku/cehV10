# Social engineering concepts
- there is no defense against social engineering; only constant vigilance can circumvent some social engineering techniques used by the attackers.
- Social engineering is the art of convincing people to reveal confidential information 
-  Common targets of social engineering include help desk personnel, technical support executives, system administrators, etc. 
-  Social engineers depend on the fact that people are unaware of their valuable information and are careless about protecting it
-  Phases of a Social Engineering Attack
    1. research on target company
    2. select target
    3. develop relationship
    4. exploit the relationship

# Social Engineering Techniques

### types of social engineering

- human based
  - Impersonation
    - Posing as a legitimate end user
    - Posing as an important user
    - Posing as a technical support
  - Eavesdropping

    - It can be done using communication channels such as telephone lines, email, instant messaging, etc.

  - Shoulder Surfing

- mobile based
  -  Publishing malicious apps 
     -  Attackers create malicious apps with attractive features and similar names to that of popular apps, and publish them on major app store
     -  Unaware, the users download these apps and get infected by malware that sends credentials to attackers
  -  Repackaging legitimate apps
  -  Using fake security applications
  -  SMiShing (SMS Phishing)

# Insider threat/ insider attack
- An insider is any employee (trusted person or persons) having access to critical assets of an organization 
- Insider attacks are generally performed by privileged user, disgruntled employee, terminated employee, accident-prone employee, third party, undertrained staff, etc.

- types
  - Malicious Insider
  - Negligent Insider
  - Professional Insider
    - These are harmful insiders who use their technical knowledge to identify the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the company’s network and sell the confidential information to the competitors or black market bidders
  - Compromised Insider

# Impersonation on Social Networking Sites 

- There are two ways an attacker can use an impersonation strategy on social networking sites: 
  -  By creating a fictitious profile of the victim on the social media site

- Good policies and procedures are ineffective if they are not taught and reinforced by the employees 
- After receiving training, employees should sign a statement acknowledging that they understand the policies
- The main objectives of social engineering defense strategies are to create user awareness, robust internal network controls, and secure policies, plans and processes
- policies to defend social engineering
  - password policy
  - phisical security policy
  - defense strategy
    - Social engineering campaign
