  ### IoT technology components

- Sensing Technology:
  -  Sensors embedded in the devices sense a wide variety of information from their surroundings like temperature, gases, location, working of some industrial machine as well as sensing health data of a patient.
-  IoT Gateways: 
    -  Gateways are used to bridge the gap between the IoT device (internal network) and the end user (external network) and thus allowing them to connect and communicate with each other. The data collected by the sensors in IoT devices send the collected data to the concerned user or cloud through the gateway
  - Cloud Server/Data Storage: 
    - The collected data after travelling through the gateway arrives at the cloud, where it is stored and undergoes data analysis. The processed data is then transmitted to the user where he/she takes certain action based on the information received by him/her
  - Remote Control using Mobile App:
    -  The end user uses remote controls such as mobile phones, tabs, laptops, etc. installed with a mobile app to monitor, control, retrieve data, and take a specific action on IoT devices from a remote location.

### IoT architecture layers

- Edge Technology Layer
  - This layer consists of all the hardware parts like sensors, RFID tags, readers or other soft sensors and the device itself. These entities are the primary part of the data sensors that are deployed in the field for monitoring or sensing various phenomena. This layer plays an important part in data collection, connecting devices within the network and with the server.
- Access Gateway Layer
  - This layer helps to bridge the gap between two endpoints like a device and a client. The very first data handling also takes place in this layer. It carries out message routing, message identification and subscribing
- internet Layer
  - This is the crucial layer as it serves as the main component in carrying out the communication between two endpoints such as device-to-device, device-to-cloud, device-to-gateway and back-end data-sharing.
- Middleware Layer
  - This is one of the most critical layers that operates in two-way mode. As the name suggests this layer sits in the middle of the application layer and the hardware layer, thus behaving as an interface between these two layers. It is responsible for important functions such as data management, device management and various issues like data analysis, data aggregation, data filtering, device information discovery and access control.
- Application Layer
    - This layer placed at the top of the stack, is responsible for the delivery of services to the respective users from different sectors like building, industrial, manufacturing, automobile, security, healthcare, etc.

### IoT vulnerabilities

- Insufficient Authentication/Authorization: 
  - Insufficient authentication refers to using weak credentials such as an insecure or weak password which offers poor security, thus allowing a hacker to gain access to the user account, and causing loss of data, loss of accountability and denying user to access the account.
- Insecure Network Services: 
  - Insecure network services are prone to various attacks like buffer overflow attacks, attacks that cause denial-of-service scenario, thus leaving the device inaccessible to the user. An attacker uses various automated tools such as port scanners and fuzzers to detect the open ports and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the services.
- Insecure Web Interface:
  -  Insecure web interface occurs when certain issues arise such as weak credentials, lack of account lockout mechanism and account enumeration. These issues result in loss of data, loss of privacy, lack of accountability, denial of access and complete device access takeover.
- Privacy Concerns: 
  - IoT devices generate some private and confidential data but due to lack of proper protection schemes, it leads to privacy concerns, which makes it is easy to discover and review the data that is being produced, sent, and collected.

### Attacks

- Rolling Code Attack: 
  - An attacker jams and sniffs the signal to obtain the code transferred to the vehicleâ€™s receiver and uses it to unlock and steal the vehicle.
- Jamming Attack: 
  - An attacker jams the signal between the sender and the receiver with malicious traffic that makes the two endpoints unable to communicate with each other.
- DDoS Attack: 
  - An attacker converts the devices into an army of botnet to target a specific system or server, making it unavailable to provide services.
- BlueBorne Attack: 
  - BlueBorne attack is performed on Bluetooth connections to gain access and take full control of the target device. Attackers connect to nearby devices and exploit the vulnerabilities of the Bluetooth protocol to compromise the devices. BlueBorne is a collection of various techniques based on the known vulnerabilities of the Bluetooth protocol.
- Sybil Attack: An attacker uses multiple forged identities to create a strong illusion of traffic congestion, affecting communication between neighboring nodes and networks.
- Replay Attack:
  -  Attackers intercept legitimate messages from a valid communication and continuously send the intercepted message to the target device to perform a denial-of-service attack or crash the target device.
- Side Channel Attack:
  -  Attackers perform side channel attacks by extracting information about encryption keys by observing the emission of signals i.e. "side channels" from IoT devices.
- Exploit Kits:
  -  Exploit kit is a malicious script used by the attackers to exploit poorly patched vulnerabilities in an IoT device. These kits are designed in such a way that whenever there are new vulnerabilities, new ways of exploitation and add on functions will be added to the device automatically.

### Codes
- Hex Code: 
  - A color hex code is a way of specifying color using hexadecimal values. The code itself is a hex triplet, which represents three separate values that specify the levels of the component colors. It is used by programmers to describe locations in memory because it can represent every byte.
- Unicode: 
  - It is a character coding system to support worldwide interchange, processing, and display of the written texts. This type of code is mostly used in evading IDS. 
- Rolling Code: 
  - the form of a code from a modern key fob that locks or unlocks the vehicle. Here a code is sent to the vehicle which is different for every other use and is only used once, that means if a vehicle receives a same code again it rejects it. This code which locks or unlocks a car or a garage is called as Rolling Code or Hopping Code. It is used in keyless entry system to prevent replay attacks. An eavesdropper can capture the code transmitted and later use it to unlock the garage or the vehicle. 
- Polymorphic Code: 
  - It is code that uses a polymorphic engine to mutate while keeping the original algorithm intact. Polymorphic code can be also used to generate encryption algorithms.
  
### Vulnerability scanning using Nmap
- Attackers use vulnerability-scanning tools such as Nmap to identify the IoT devices connected to the network along with their open ports and services. - - Nmap generates raw IP packets in different ways to identify live hosts or devices on the network, services offered by them, their operating systems, type of packet filters used, etc. 
- Attackers use the following Nmap command to scan a particular IP address:
  - nmap -n -Pn -sS -pT:0-65535 -v -A -oX <Name><IP>
- To perform complete scan of the IoT device that checks for both TCP and UDP services and ports:
  - nmap -n -Pn -sSU -pT:0-65535,U:0-65535 -v -A -oX <Name><IP>

  - nmap -6 -n -Pn -sSU -pT:0-65535,U:0-65535 -v -A -oX <Name><IP>

### phases of IoT hacking

- Vulnerability Scanning: 
  - Once the attackers gather information about a target device, they search for the attack surfaces of a device (identify the vulnerabilities) which they can attack. Vulnerability scanning allows an attacker to find the total number of vulnerabilities present in the firmware, infrastructure and system components of an IoT device that is accessible. After identifying the attack surface area, the attacker will scan for vulnerabilities in that area to identify an attack vector and perform further exploitation on the device.
- Gain Access: 
  - Vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability scanning phase allow an attacker to remotely gain access, command and control the attack while evading detection from various security products. Based on the vulnerabilities in an IoT device, the attacker may turn the device into a backdoor to gain access to an organizationâ€™s network without infecting any end system that is protected by IDS/IPS, firewall, antivirus software, etc.
- Information Gathering: 
  - The first and the foremost step in IoT device hacking is to extract information such as IP address, protocols used (Zigbee, BLE, 5G, IPv6LoWPAN, etc.), open ports, device type, Geo location of a device, manufacturing number and manufacturing company of a device. In this step, an attacker also identifies the hardware design, its infrastructure and the main components embedded on a target device that is present online.
- Launch Attacks:
  -  In vulnerability scanning phase, attackers try to find out the vulnerabilities present in the target device. The vulnerabilities found are then exploited further to launch various attacks such as DDoS attacks, rolling code attacks, jamming signal attacks, Sybil attacks, MITM attacks, data and identity theft attacks, etc.
